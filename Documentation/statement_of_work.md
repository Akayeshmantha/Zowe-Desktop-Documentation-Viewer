# Project Description

- A new default web application enabling users to view text & pdf documents bundled into plugins. 

- This viewer can be invoked via the Desktopâ€™s App2App communication scheme so that it can be popped up on-demand by the plugin, or opened directly by the user for them to be able to drill-down to each plugin & each documentation file.

## Current State

The Zowe documentation viewer is being built from scratch in this mentorship 2020 program.

## Value

- The Zowe Virtual Desktop has different plugins and each plugin has its documentation.

- Various types of documentation generally reside in file formats that browsers can visualize, be it PDF or text or markdown, it would be convenient to present this documentation in the one place where the plugins run. 

- The documentation viewer will help to achieve this and add value to the API catalog.

## Business Requirements

- Implement a documentation viewer application and make it ready to be added in the API catalog. 

- Show all available plugins.
    - A plugin may have a variety of documentation with them: 
        - Readmes
        - Licenses
        - Guides
        - API documentation and more. 

- A standard viewer & standard packaging scheme to show the documentation.
