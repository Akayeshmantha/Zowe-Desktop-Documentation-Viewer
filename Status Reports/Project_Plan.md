## Project Description

The Zowe Virtual Desktop has different plugins and each plugin has its own documentation. Main goal of the project is to implement a documentation viewer application and make it ready to be added in the API catalog. Plugins may have a variety of documentation that are shipped with them: readme, licenses, guides, api documentation and more. As the various types of documentation generally resides in file formats that browsers can visualize, be it PDF or text or markdown, it would be convenient to present this documentation in the same place where the plugins run. A standard viewer & standard packaging scheme is needed so that plugin developers do not instead come up with their own way to solve the same problem, multiple times.

## Deliverables

A new default web application will enable users to view text & pdf documents bundled into plugins. This viewer can be invoked via the Desktopâ€™s App2App communication scheme so that it can be popped up on-demand by the plugin, or opened directly by the user for them to be able to drill-down to each plugin & each documentation file.
